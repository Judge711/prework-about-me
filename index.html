      <p>I've always wanted to be in the tech field. Growing up I always thought I wanted to do custom PC building as I had a love and passion for it and still do to this day building PC's for friends and family. But I now find myself wanting to do and learn more and I think that web development is a creative and fullfilling career that I feel will be enjoyable to me.</p>
